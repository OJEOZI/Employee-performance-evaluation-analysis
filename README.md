## EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

### Introduction
Towards the end of 2023, Sweettooth confectionaries and Cornerstore Cafe was about to carry out its performance appraisal in its usual manner. This time, a paperless, more accurate, method of carrying out this excercise was introduced. The aim of this project was to have a more efficient, less bias and less time consuming performance appraisal.
### Basic goals of this project
* Identify employees that have performed well over average.
* Recognize employees that have done averagely well and would require training in some necessary area.
* Identify employees that have failed to meet minimum requirements of the organisation.
* Observe the relationships(if any) betweeen metrics in terms of how various employees fared in the grading exercise.
* Recognize patterns or relationships(if any) between groups'(employees in a department) performance in a particular metric and their individual performances.
* Finally identify employees' strenghts and weaknesses.
### Actionable results
* In line with the organisation's policies, employees who performed well over average are to be rewarded appropraitely.
* Training sessions was organised focusing on those weakenesses majoority of the employees had. for example more emphasis was laid on efficient sales techniques and positive inter-perrsonal relationships.
* In line with the organisation's standard, employees whom have repeatedly failed to meet the minimum requirements were to be laid off.
* It was noticed that some employees had higher ratings in the KPI metrics while scoring quite lower in the inter-personal relationship section. These set of employees would be told about the importance of balace at the work place. however some employees seem to have created this balance already as their ratings in the various metrics reflects. 
* The employee with the least KPI rating had 71%, others had over 70 and few others over 80% while the group score for the KPI metric was 70%. While this is an "A", it indicates that the employees in that group could use some more team work in order to record higher higher group ratings which would also mean higher individual ratings.
* Aside the general trainings, managers and supervisors were to have one-on-one sessions with employees with certain weaknesses as regards carrying out their duties.
### Data Collection and Data Cleaning
Direct supervisors and managers of employees who are due for appraisal graded these employees' performance in the last 6 months based on some specific metrics. with a grade range of 5-1. 5 being the highest and 1 being the least. The metrics for evaluation was broadly divided into 3; Individual performance and characteristics, interpersonal relationships and Key performance indicators. The gradings was then entered in an Excel sheet. The cleaning process was done with Microsoft Excel; appropraitely attending to duplicates, missing values, unnecessary columns etc., checking validity of data and ensuring all columns had the right data type.
### Data Analysis and Vizualization
Part of the analysis(initial aggregation of ratings and getting percentages) cas carried out on Microsoft Excel. While SQL queries was written to return results more the rest of the analysis. Functions such as the GROUP BYs, WHERE, LIKE appropraitely utilized. This project was vizualized on Excel.
